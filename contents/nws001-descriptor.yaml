        Hi, my fellow hipsters!

        I know you’ve been waiting for this announcement for a long time. JHipster 7 has been released! This is a BIG major version so I can’t promise to cover every detail in the release, but I’d like to share my favorite features with you.

        Let’s go for a quick overview.

        A few numbers to start
        22 months have passed since the last major release has been made
        25 intermediate releases, one release every 3.5 weeks
        3833 commits have been merged
        2371 tickets/PR have been closed
        18.2k GitHub stars and 613 contributors
        The v7 release is for sure the biggest release made by the community.
